            moreDetails:"Elaborating on the same, Mithun spoke about how he was disrespected because of his skin colour.'I never want anybody to go through what I have gone through in life. Everyone has seen struggles and fought through difficult days, but I was always called out for my skin colour. I have been disrespected for a lot of years because of my skin colour and I have seen days when I had to sleep with an empty stomach, and I used to cry myself to sleep,' he said. The actor also mentioned that there were days when he had to think about what his next meal will be, and where he will go to sleep. He further said: 'I have also slept on the footpath for a lot of days. And that's the only reason I don't want my biopic to be ever made. My story will never inspire anyone, it will break them down (mentally) and discourage people from achieving their dreams. I don't want that to happen! If I can do it, anyone else can do it.'",
